Our research primarily focuses on neural oscillations during attention and memory processes in humans. We use a broad array of electrophysiological and imaging methods from the global scale, such as EEG ([paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002528)), MEG ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213005150?via%3Dihub)), fMRI ([paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25557#:~:text=Empathy%20relies%20on%20the%20ability,is%20yet%20to%20be%20shown.)), combined EEG-fMRI ([paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49562)), to the local scale such as intracranial EEG ([paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1914180116?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)) and single unit recordings in humans ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428480v3)).

Going beyond correlating oscillations with cognition, we also study the causal role of oscillations by externally perturbing the brain via rhythmic sensory stimulation (i.e. flickering or amplitude modulated sounds), rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and investigate the impact of such oscillatory perturbations on cognition. Finally, we integrate the findings of both data streams (i.e. correlative and causal) via  computational models. These models make specific predictions which we test in correlational and causal experiments. With this multidisciplinary, multimodal and multiscale approach we hope to be able to draw a detailed picture of how the human brain perceives, stores and retrieves information.
, but we are also interested in how these processes are affected in clinical populations, like patients suffering from Schizophrenia, Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder (PTSD) or Alzheimer's Disease
