# Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity Statement

## The current scientific challenges are best addressed by a diverse group of scientists who come together as a team. Our lab is an inclusive and safe place that welcomes members with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and disciplines. We believe that everyone should have an equal chance in succeeding in science, regardless where they come from and what their background is.
