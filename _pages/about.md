Thoughts, feelings, or a face we attend to are produced by orchestrated neural firing patterns in distributed brain networks. Precise timing of this neural activity is required in order to represent information in brain networks, and to form lasting memories. Neural oscillations establish such precise timing. We investigate neural oscillations to understand how the brain implements cognition.
